This project is from 2023<br/>
Given the coordinates of crimes from 2011-2016 in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, this project uses CUDA (parallel programming) and K-Means clustering (machine learning) to analyze where crimes in the city are concentrated.<br/>
If crimes are centralized in certain areas, it may help the police identify areas needing more support in order to improve their response times.<br/>
The data used was publicly available via the Baltimore Police Department.
